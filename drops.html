    <h2 class="topp">What are Raptor NFTs?</h2>
        <p class="drop-info topp">My name is Mohammad, and I'm the creator/owner of Raptor NFTs. The Raptor NFT collection began on April 3rd, 2022 when the first Raptor NFT drop took place, and 8 lucky players were quick enough to claim ownership of the first Raptor NFTs avilable. The idea behind creating this collection is to have some fun with my FarmRPG community in creating anticipation for drops, and to promote farmers to engage with Raptors more as they are too often neglected in light of regular farm pets having an exclusive profile spotlight.
            <br>
            <br>
            What does it mean to be an owner of a Raptor NFT? Not only do you have the right to name/rename that raptor, but your name and raptor get showcased as a part of this exclusive collection on our website! With ownership, you have full authority to sell/trade your Raptor NFT to another FarmRPG player for any in-game item. 
            <br>
            <br>
           <span class="bold"> Become the next owner of a Raptor NFT by being one of the firsts to claim one in our next drop!</span>
        </p>

        <h2 class="bottom">How do drops work?</h2>
        <p class="drop-info bottom">At the specified drop time, my full <a href="https://farmrpg.com/#!/profile.php?user_name=Mohammad" class="my-prof"> mailbox</a> will open up with the amount of spots equal to the amount of Raptors available during that drop. To claim one of these raptors, you must be one of the first players to send in the requested item into my mailbox before it becomes full again. Before every drop, the item will be specified. If you are able to send me the requested item before my mailbox becomes full again, you will have successfully won a Raptor NFT!</p>
